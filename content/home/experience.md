        I worked as a researcher at STARS lab under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Kelly. For my project, I created a learning-based algorithm to perceive in-hand object slip using inexpensive [barometric tactile sensors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6877681). A [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13460) on this topic, submitted to ICRA 2022, is currently under review. During the course of my masters, I have received the [NSERC Canadian Graduate Scholarship](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp) and the [Vector Scholarship in AI](https://vectorinstitute.ai/scholarship/).

      Worked in a team of 25 machine learning engineers, led by Dr. Urs Muller, creating an end-to-end autonomous driving solution. (Linux, C++, Git, Bash)
      * Contributed to the re-architecture of Nvidia’s Driving Simulation application in order to enable simulation on the GPU cluster and standardize the benchmark testing of DriveNets across the company
      * Developed a prototype of a model-predictive vehicle controller in C++ that runs on the DRIVE Xavier platform
      * Contributed to Nvidia DriveWorks SDK which meant overcoming extensive quality checks designed for MISRA compliance

      Worked on Nvidia's DRIVE hardware stack, aiming to revolutionize the Automotive computing industry (C++, bash, python)
      * Contributed to the Embedded PDK for the DRIVE automotive hardware products, that now serve giants like Tesla and Audi.
      * Re-implemented the Tegra flashing software for the DRIVE computing platforms to meet strict Automotive standards and to gain MISRA compliance.
      * Architected the incremental Tegra flashing functionality, reducing the average OS flash time to half.

      As a core member of the software development team, I worked closely with the R&D department to prototype a new application for their tool tracking system.
      * Prototyped a cranial navigation Mac OS application using the existing tracking system
      * Worked with OpenGL based Visualization Toolkit (VTK) for 3D image rendering
      * Gained understanding of computer vision algorithms used for sphere tracking
      * Exposed to optimisation algorithms used for shape matching
